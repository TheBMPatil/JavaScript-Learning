# Day 01 - Learning JavaScript ðŸš€  

Welcome to my first day of learning JavaScript! Today, I explored the basics of JavaScript, its purpose, and how to set up an environment for running JS code.

## What is JavaScript?  
JavaScript (JS) is a powerful, versatile programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. Although its name includes "Java," there is **no connection** between Java and JavaScript. It's like comparing a "car" and a "carpet"â€”completely different things!

## Key Learnings  

### JavaScript Engines  
JavaScript code needs an engine to execute. Some popular JS engines include:  
- **V8**: Used by Google Chrome and Node.js  
- **SpiderMonkey**: Developed by Mozilla for Firefox  
- **Deno**: A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript  
- **Node.js**: A runtime that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser  

### Running JavaScript  
Most JavaScript runs directly in the browser, which is perfectly fine for beginners and web developers. However, we can also run JS code on servers or locally using **Node.js**.

## Environment Setup  

1. Installed **Node.js (LTS version)** on my system.  
2. Verified the installation by running:  
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
